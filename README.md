# Brand Name Generator

This project is a simple Python script that generates a brand name based on user input. It's part of my journey to learn Python through the Udemy 100 Days of Code: Python course.

## Description

The script prompts the user for the name of the city they grew up in and their pet's name, then combines these to suggest a brand name.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone the repository:
